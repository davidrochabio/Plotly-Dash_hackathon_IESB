This repository consists of the python script that analyses the 2016 Polar Dataset, provided by Mateus Mendelson (https://github.com/mendelson, https://github.com/mendelson/polar-sample-database). The script also generates a Dash dashboard with plotly graphs.

Just put the script and all of the json files in the same folder and run it in your terminal. It should generate a link and a dashboard that you can access through your web browser.
